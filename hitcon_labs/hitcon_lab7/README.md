# HITCON LAB7 Solution

This is my first ever format string exploit! I was kinda hesistating learning this (idk why) and after some frustration (of not wanting to learn but still be able to solve the chall) I looked at the given solution... Even though it works after that I felt guilty and started learning fmtstr vulns.  

**LIVEOVERFLOW** came to save a day! I learned how we can overwrite addresses in memory and now my exploit is completely different from the one given in solution!
