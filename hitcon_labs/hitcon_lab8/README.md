# HITCON LAB8 Solution

Another interesting printf chall. I guess I actually had to learn leaking addresses in LAB7 and writing to addresses in LAB8 but instead I solved both by writing to addresses XD.  

I solved the first part very easily but the second part was a bit tricky. As you can see my `exploit2.py` is quite lame as compared to `exploit1.py`. Anyways I solved both!! Yay!
