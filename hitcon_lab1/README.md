# HITCON Lab1 Solution

This is probably the easiest of all challenges but I still wasted one whole day figuring out what to do.
All you have to do in this challenge is get the random value from stack and give it to stack in the debugger itself.  
You'll get the flag : `CTF{debugger_1s_so_p0werful_1n_dyn4m1c_4n4lySis!}`
